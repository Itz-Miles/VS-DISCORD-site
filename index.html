      <p>
        Thanks for heading here to play Vs Discord! <br>
        Unfortunately due to unforeseen circumstances, the team and I terminated the project before it could be completed. <br> 
        Despite this, we're still proud of what work we put into it. We still want to share it to everyone! <br> <br> 
    
        Please keep in mind that this is an unfinished build and may contain bugs, glitches, and incomplete features. <br>
        We're unable to provide any help or support for this build, as it's provided on an "as is" basis.
        
        I hope you enjoy exploring the build inside and out. <br>
        Thanks for being patient!
      </p>
