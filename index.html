            Thanks for heading here to play Vs Discord! <br>
            Unfortunately due to unforeseen circumstances, the team and I terminated the project before it could be completed. <br> 
            Despite this, we're still proud of what work we put into it. We want to share our stuff with everyone! <br> <br>
          </p>  
          <p>
          Below is an HTML5 build of the game. <br>
           Please keep in mind that this build was unfinished and may contain bugs, glitches, and incomplete features. <br>
           We're unable to provide any help or support for it either, since it's provided on an "as is" basis. <br> <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I hope you enjoy exploring the build inside and out. <br>
           Thanks for being patient!
