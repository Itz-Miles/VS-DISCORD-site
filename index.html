            Thanks for heading here to play Vs Discord! <br>
            Unfortunately, the mod isn't done yet! Versus Discord is currently undergoing Version 0 development. <br>
            Despite this, we're still hosting the mod to the public while we work on it. We want to share our stuff with everyone! <br> <br>
          </p>  
          <p>
          Below is an HTML5 build of the game. <br>
           Please keep in mind that this build is unfinished and may contain bugs, glitches, and incomplete features. <br>
           We're unable to provide any help or support for it either, since it's updated on an "as is" basis. <br> <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I hope you enjoy exploring the build so far inside and out. <br>
           Thanks for being patient!
        </p>
